# Blair

Blair is an open-source multi-purpose discord bot. It's an WIP, so expect things to be broken and zero docs right now. I plan on doing a serie of blog posts explaining the process of creating a discord bot as soon as I finish this project (or get it into an usable state).

Even as a WIP, this bot has a working canvas rendering method (see pokedex.js) which may be useful for beginners and people with existing bots that have not implemented image generation.

Feel free to use the code here and also to ask me anything about it, I'll gladly point the way.
